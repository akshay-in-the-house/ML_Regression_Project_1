# Flight Fare Prediction Project Using Machine Learning

Description:

Booking flight tickets can be a daunting task for travelers, with constantly fluctuating fares influenced by various factors such as destination, arrival or departure time, airline, duration of flight, etc. Existing online travel platforms often lack transparency, making it difficult for individuals to understand the pricing dynamics and secure the best deal. Therefore, there is a need to create a reliable flight fare prediction system that can assist travelers in estimating ticket prices and ultimately help them save time and money.

Objective:

* The objective of this project is to accurately predict future flight fares by analyzing relevant features such as locations (source and destination), dates of journey, airlines, flight duration, and other influencing factors. 
* The prediction results can be beneficial for both travelers, who can use reliable fare estimates, allowing them to plan their trips with confidence and make informed decisions about their travel, and for airlines, who can use it to forecast competitor's rates and adjust their pricing strategies to maximize revenue while remaining competitive.
