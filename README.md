# Flight Fare Prediction Project Using Machine Learning


Description:
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.


Early Signs of Diabetes:
* Hunger and fatigue. Our body converts the food we eat into glucose that our cells use for energy.
* Peeing more often and being thirstier
* Dry mouth and itchy skin
* Blurred vision


Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a patient is suffering from Diabetes. The dataset consists of several independent/ predictor variables and a dependent/ target variable.
